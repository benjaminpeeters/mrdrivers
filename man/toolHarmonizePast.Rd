\title{Tool to harmonize future data to past data, without modifying the past data}
\usage{
toolHarmonizePast(past, future, method = "level", yEnd = 2100)
}
\arguments{
\item{past}{A magpie object with only one scenario/datatype, i.e. the length of the third dimension should be 1.}

\item{future}{A magpie object.}

\item{method}{A string defining the harmonization method:
\itemize{
\item "level": the harmonized time-series is exactly equal to 'future' in the years after the last year
of 'past'.
\item "growth": the harmonized time-series follows the same growth rates as 'future', in the years
after the last year of 'past'.
\item "transition": the harmonized time-series transitions to 'future' by the year 'yEnd'. After yEnd, the
harmonized time-series is equal to 'future'. In the transition phase, a share of the absolute difference
between past' and future' in the last year of past' is added to future. This share starts at 1 in the
last year of 'past' and decreases linearly to 0 by yEnd.
}}

\item{yEnd}{Additional input for "transition" method. Year by which the transition period is completed.}
}
\value{
A magpie object with the same dimensions as 'future'.
}
\description{
Like all harmonization tools in mrdrivers, toolHarmonizePast takes two magpie objects, 'past' and 'future',
and returns a single magpie object, i.e. the harmonized time-series. In this case, the harmonized time-series is
always equal to 'past', in the years of 'past'. After that the harmonized time-series depends on the 'method'
argument chosen.
}
\section{Dimensions of 'past' and 'future'}{
If the 'future' object has multiple scenarios/datatypes, i.e. the length of the third dimension is larger than 1,
then the a harmonized time-series is created for every scenario/datatype in future. The same 'past' object is used
in every case - hence the requirement that 'past' only have one scenario/datatype.
